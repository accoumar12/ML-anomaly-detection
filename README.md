# Machine Learning Anomaly detection project

This is the repo presenting ACCOU Martin's class project for the Machine Learning ISAE-SUPAERO course.

You can find the assignment requirements in the *anomaly_detection_exercise.pdf* file.

The first notebook do look at is the data exploration one. It is followed by the anomaly detection notebook.
